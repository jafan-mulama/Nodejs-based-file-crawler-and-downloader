# Node.js-based-file-crawler-and-downloader.
This Node.js script recursively downloads files from a specified base URL and saves them locally, maintaining the directory structure. It uses node-fetch to fetch files, cheerio to parse directory listings, and fs for file operations. It avoids revisiting URLs and skips excluded directories.
